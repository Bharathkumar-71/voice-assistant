# 🎙️ Virtual Voice Assistant using Python 🤖

## 🔍 Overview  
This project is a smart, AI-integrated **Virtual Voice Assistant** built using Python. It allows users to **control their system and retrieve information hands-free**, making it ideal for elderly people, children, and visually impaired users. By leveraging speech recognition and natural language processing, the assistant listens, understands, and responds to voice commands in real-time.

It serves as a **personal productivity tool** and a step toward more accessible human-computer interaction.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎤 **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Uses `pyttsx3` to convert the assistant’s responses to audio output.
- 🌐 **Web Integration**: Searches queries on the web, opens websites like YouTube, Google, etc.
- 🕒 **Time and Date Info**: Tells current time and date.
- 🗃️ **System Operations**: Opens applications like Notepad, Calculator, Command Prompt, or system folders.
- 🎵 **Media Control**: Plays music from your system’s music folder.
- 🤖 **Gemini-Pro API Integration**: Uses Google’s Gemini Pro AI for intelligent and contextual responses.
- 🧓 **Accessible Design**: Built keeping in mind users who prefer or require voice-only interactions.
